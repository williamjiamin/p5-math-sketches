# Sketch File Workflow

Every time you **create, rename, or delete** a numbered sketch `.js` file (e.g. `17.My Sketch.js`), you MUST perform ALL of the following steps before finishing:

## 1. Regenerate the sketch list

Run this command (the node binary is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`):

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" && node update-sketches.js
```

This updates `sketches-list.js` and `sketches.json` so `index.html` can load the new sketch.

**Verify** the output lists the correct number of sketches and includes the new file.

## 2. Update the README sketch table

Open `README.md` and add/update the row in the `## Sketches` table to match the new file. Keep the table sorted by sketch number.

## 3. Commit and push (when user asks)

When committing, always include these files in the same commit:
- The new/changed sketch `.js` file
- `sketches-list.js` (auto-generated)
- `sketches.json` (auto-generated)
- `README.md` (updated table)

## Naming convention

Sketch files follow the pattern: `{number}.{Title}.js` — e.g. `16.Angle Complimentary and Supplementary .js`

## Common mistake to avoid

NEVER commit a new sketch without running `node update-sketches.js` first. The sketch will not appear in the browser dropdown if the list files are stale.
